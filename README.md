# 👋 Hi, I'm Vera Malavolti


🎓 Data Analyst & Data Science Student @ Start2Impact University

📍 Based in Rome, Italy

💡 Passionate about data-driven insights, storytelling, and meaningful analysis.

I explore the intersection between **data, culture, and design** — using analytics not only to interpret the world, but to transform it in socially and environmentally meaningful ways. 
My background in anthropology shapes a critical and human-centered approach to data, while my training in AI and UX helps me translate insights into actionable systems and experiences.
My tools: **Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib), SQL, and Tableau.**
